# Product Owners – example checklist

This brief checklist helps you remember the most important things to become a good Product Owner.
 
## Product Vision 

 * I have a product vision (created with customers, end users, and investors, when possible) 
 * I can answer questions about the product vision and business model in a concise and motivating way 
 * I have a short tagline for the product vision, for example “1,000 songs in your pocket” (iPod in 2001),             
to communicate the essence and value of the product release. 
 
## Stakeholders 

 * I understand the needs of my stakeholders (especially customers, end users, and investors)  
 * I communicate regularly with the stakeholders to understand their needs and to manage their expectations
 * I can answer questions about how each product backlog item will generate value for the stakeholders 
 * I am motivated to work as a Product Owner, and make sure I have the stakeholders’ mandate and trust 
 * My forecasts towards stakeholders are based on development team’s measured velocity or throughput

## Product Backlog  

 * I have a product backlog 
 * I have a mandate to make decisions about the product backlog 
 * I update the product backlog at least before each sprint planning meeting 
 * The product backlog is accessible to all scrum team members 
 * The product backlog items are ordered (based on value, risk, work estimates, dependencies, etc.)  
 * The product backlog items are clearly expressed and more detailed towards the top 
 * I regularly refine the product backlog with at least one developer to get the top of the product backlog 
ready for the next sprint (or release) planning meeting. 
 
## Development Team 

 * I am available to my developers during the sprint to clarify requirements 
 * I protect my development team from anyone who tries to change the sprint’s product backlog items 
 * There is only one Product Owner who chooses the product backlog items and refines them with the 
development team. Otherwise, developers do not know who to listen. 
 * I motivate my development team by occasionally describing my product vision, including the planned 
benefits and impacts of the next product release or increment
 * I motivate and train my developers by involving them in writing and analyzing user stories, when possible 
(thus also reducing my own work)
 * I trust my Scrum team’s development capabilities. If not, I will try and build trust by offering them training, 
recruiting, better communication, personnel changes, etc. 
 * My Scrum team trusts my business domain and end user knowledge. If not, I will try and build trust by 
improving my own and the Scrum team’s business and end user understanding. 
 * I have a similar understanding of the Definition of Done with the Scrum team 
 
## Scrum Master 

 * A Scrum Master is appointed (preferably by the development team, when possible) 
 * I have a good understanding and trust with my Scrum Master. If not, I work together with my Scrum Master 
to improve our cooperation. 
 
## Scrum Events 

 * I participate in sprint planning meetings to select the product backlog items with the team 
 * I participate in sprint review meetings, give and gather constructive feedback, and verify which of the selected product 
backlog items fulfill their unique Acceptance Criteria and the general Definition of Done. 
 * I participate in retrospective meetings to observe and improve my own work as a Product Owner 
 * I work with my development team even on daily basis, when needed, to clarify the requirements, work on 
the design, and optimize the outcome of the sprint.
 * I have scheduled sprint events with the Scrum Master (for example as recurring calendar events)
